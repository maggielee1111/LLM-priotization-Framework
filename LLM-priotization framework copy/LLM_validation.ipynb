The overarching term \"coronary microvascular dysfunction\" (CMD) has been applied broadly - but is it correct? We present a series of case examples culminating a systematic exploration of our large clinical database to distinguish among four categories of coronary pathophysiology. First, by far the largest group of \"no stenosis angina\" patients exhibits subendocardial ischemia during intact flow through diffuse epicardial disease during dipyridamole vasodilator stress. Second, rare patients indeed have ischemic signs or symptoms due solely to reduced flow attributable to microvascular dysfunction but without subendocardial hypoperfusion. Third, a previously unrecognized group of patients displays significant ST-segment changes and rare angina but normal high dipyridamole induced coronary flow and intact normal subendocardial uptake, perhaps due to a stretch mechanism from hyperemia. Fourth, ischemia due to reduced flow plus a subendocardial defect can arise as a secondary effect of a variety of global cardiac pathology, for example severe diffuse atherosclerosis, severe aortic stenosis, or a primary cardiomyopathy. Because subendocardial ischemia dominates the pathophysiologic epidemiology of these patient categories, understanding its mechanisms and therefore potential treatment targets will bring the largest clinical benefits t...\n",

With advances in diagnostic imaging techniques, LVHT is being recognised in an increasing number of people. The scientific data show the possibility of the overdiagnosis of this cardiomyopathy in a population of people who have very high levels of physical activity. We describe the case of a young athlete with no medical history, who presented with syncope during a marathon running race. Initial evaluation showed elevated troponin I; transthoracic echocardiography showed a trabeculated ventricle and subsequent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) revealed left ventricular hypertrabeculation (LVHT). During subsequent evaluation by tilt table testing, vasovagal syncope was identified as the likely aetiology of the syncope. The patient was advised to cease sports and stimulants like caffeine use. At the 29-month follow-up, CMR showed the normalisation of the non-compacted to compacted myocardial ratio and an improvement in left ventricular function, with no further syncopal episodes reported. This is an example of the physiological hypertrabeculation of the LV apex in a recreational endurance athlete, with the normalisation of the non-compacted to compacted myocardial layer ratio after detraining. Physiological hypertrabeculation, a benign component of exercise-induced cardiac remodelling, must be differentiated from non-compaction cardiomyopathy and other pathologies causing syncope.

Although hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy is the most common cause of SCD, some other genetic abnormalities have been identified as proarrhythmic. However, there is not routine screening for these other genetic abnormalities. Furthermore, consumption of caffeine, stimulant medication, or prolonged exercise can potentiate the underlying arrhythmic potential. In the event of SCD, advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) should be performed immediately and exactly. The authors present a case of an otherwise healthy young male who collapsed during a marathon and could not be resuscitated despite aggressive measures. After aggressive resuscitative efforts, the patient ultimately expired. A postmortem autopsy revealed no cardiac structural abnormalities, and the cause of death was determined to be cardiac arrhythmia of undetermined etiology. Postmortem genetic testing revealed a heterozygous variation in calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit beta 2 (CACNB2), a gene associated with arrhythmia and calcium channelopathy. Toxicology showed therapeutic levels of amphetamine. This case highlights the eminent risk of cardiac death in young athletes with proarrhythmic genetic variations, especially in the setting of endurance sport.\n",

In particular, the possibility of observing maturation processes in a simple culture dish opens novel perspectives in the study of early-disease defects caused by genetic mutations before the onset of clinical manifestations. For instance, calcium handling abnormalities are considered as a leading cause of cardiomyocyte dysfunction in several genetic-based dilated cardiomyopathies, including rare types such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)-associated cardiomyopathy. To better define the maturation of calcium handling we simultaneously measured action potential and calcium transients (Ca-Ts) using fluorescent indicators at specific time points. We combined micropatterned substrates with long-term cultures to improve maturation of hiPSC-CMs (60, 75 or 90 days post-differentiation). Control-(hiPSC)-CMs displayed increased maturation over time (90 vs 60 days), with longer action potential duration (APD), increased Ca-T amplitude, faster Ca-T rise (time to peak) and Ca-T decay (RT50). The progressively increased contribution of the SR to Ca release (estimated by post-rest potentiation or Caffeine-induced Ca-Ts) appeared as the main determinant of the progressive rise of Ca-T amplitude during maturation.

It was, however, learned that he had consumed 8 to 10 cans of energy drinks per day (3.5-4 Lit/d) in the 2-week period leading to the hospital admission. Physical examination revealed bilateral diffuse rales and 2+ pretibial edema. Echocardiography showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 25% with global left ventricular hypokinesia and dilated left ventricular dimensions. Coronary angiography demonstrated normal coronary arteries. On cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, the left ventricle was dilated, and the systolic function was reduced. No pathological enhancement was observed. This case report and many previous studies support a possible link between caffeinated energy drinks and cardiovascular events.\n",

In the early concealed phase, the ACM heart is at high risk of sudden cardiac death before cardiac remodeling occurs because of mistargeted ion channels and altered Ca(2+) handling. However, the results of pathogenic PKP2 variants on myocyte contraction in ACM pathogenesis remain unknown. METHODS: We studied the outcomes of a human truncating variant of PKP2 on myocyte contraction using a novel knock-in mouse model with insertion of thymidine in exon 5 of Pkp2, which mimics a familial case of ACM (PKP2-L404fsX5). We used serial echocardiography, electrocardiography, blood pressure measurements, histology, cardiomyocyte contraction, intracellular calcium measurements, and gene and protein expression studies. RESULTS: Serial echocardiography of Pkp2 heterozygous (Pkp2-Het) mice revealed progressive failure of the right ventricle (RV) in animals older than 3 months. By contrast, left ventricular function remained normal. ECGs of 6-month-old anesthetized Pkp2-Het mice showed normal baseline heart rates and QRS complexes. Cardiac responses to beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (2 mg/kg) plus caffeine (120 mg/kg) were also normal.

      "- description: Acetylcysteine (also known as N-acetylcysteine or N-acetyl-L-cysteine or NAC) is primarily used as a mucolytic agent and in the management of acetaminophen poisoning. It is a derivative of cysteine with an acetyl group attached to the amino group of cysteine. NAC is essentially a prodrug that is converted to cysteine (in the intestine by the enzyme aminoacylase 1) and absorbed in the intestine into the blood stream. Cysteine is a key constituent to glutathione and hence administration of acetylcysteine replenishes glutathione stores. Acetylcysteine can also be used as a general antioxidant which can help mitigate symptoms for a variety of diseases exacerbated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). For instance, acetylcysteine is commonly used in individuals with renal impairment to prevent the precipitation of acute renal failure. Acetylcysteine has been shown to have efficacy in treating mild to moderate traumatic brain injury including ischemic brain injury, particularly in reducing neuronal losses, and also reducing cognitive and neurological symptoms when administered promptly after injury. N-acetylcysteine is now widely used in the treatment of HIV, and it has reported efficacy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and contrast-induced nephropathy. Acetylcysteine is also being successfully used to treat a variety of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders including cocaine, cannabis, and smoking addictions, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, autism, compulsive and grooming disorders, schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder. Recent data also shows that N-acetylcysteine inhibits muscle fatigue and can be used to enhance performance in endurance events and in exercise and endurance training.\n",
      "- mechanism_of_action: Acetylcysteine protects against acetaminophen overdose-induced hepatotoxicity by maintaining or restoring hepatic concentrations of glutathione. It does this by producing the glutathione precursor L-cysteine. Glutathione is required to inactivate an intermediate metabolite (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine or NAPQI) of acetaminophen that is thought to be hepatotoxic. In acetaminophen overdose cases, excessive quantities of this metabolite are formed because the primary metabolic (glucuronide and sulfate conjugation) pathways become saturated. Acetylcysteine may act by reducing the metabolite to the parent compound and/or by providing sulfhydryl for conjugation of the metabolite. Experimental evidence also suggests that a sulfhydryl-containing compound such as acetylcysteine may also directly inactivate the metabolite. The mechanisms of action for acetylcysteine’s well-known mucolytic effects are different. In particular, when inhaled, acetylcysteine (and its metabolic byproduct cysteine) exerts its mucolytic action through its free sulfhydryl group, which reduces the disulfide bonds in the mucus matrix and lowers mucus viscosity. This action increases with increasing pH and is most significant at pH 7 to 9. The mucolytic action of acetylcysteine is not affected by the presence of DNA. Acetylcysteine is also an antioxidant and reduces oxidative stress. Acetylcysteine serves as a prodrug to L-cysteine which is a precursor to the biologic antioxidant, glutathione and hence administration of acetylcysteine replenishes glutathione stores. L-cysteine also serves as a precursor to cystine which in turn serves as a substrate for the cystine-glutamate antiporter on astrocytes hence increasing glutamate release into the extracellular space. This glutamate in turn acts on mGluR2/3 receptors, and at higher doses of acetylcysteine, mGluR5. Glutathione also modulates the NMDA receptor by acting at the redox site. These effects on glutamate and NMDA signaling appear to explain some of the positive neuropsychotropic effects associated with NAC. Acetylcysteine also possesses some anti-inflammatory effects possibly via inhibiting NF-κB through redox activation of the nuclear factor kappa kinases thereby modulating cytokine synthesis.\n",
      "- pharmacodynamics: Acetylcysteine has been shown to reduce the extent of liver injury following acetaminophen overdose. It is most effective when given early, with benefit seen principally in patients treated within 8-10 hours of the overdose. Acetylcysteine likely protects the liver by maintaining or restoring the glutathione levels, or by acting as an alternate substrate for conjugation with, and thus detoxification of, the reactive metabolite.\n",

AIM: To describe the pattern of WCD at 1 year in patients with ATTR-CM on tafamidis and explore the association with mortality and cardiovascular (CV) hospitalisation. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with ATTR-CM at Columbia University after 2018 who were treated with tafamidis were enrolled in the study. WCD was defined as: increase in NT-proBNP >700 pg/mL and >30% from baseline or oral diuretic intensification (ODI) or both.

Echocardiography provides prognostic information through some important parameters: left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and global longitudinal strain (GLS). However, LVEF often remains preserved despite disease progression, and GLS is not routinely performed as it is limited by suboptimal image quality. The stroke volume index (SVi) has already been shown to correlate with mortality in heart failure patients; still, its prognostic role in transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (TTR-CA) is poorly studied. PURPOSE: This prospective study aimed to evaluate the role of SVi in predicting mortality and heart failure hospitalizations in patients with cardiac amyloidosis, comparing it to other parameters of left ventricular performance. METHODS: Baseline clinical transthoracic echocardiogram and laboratory data were collected prospectively in 115 patients with diagnosed TTR-CA. The outcome was the occurrence of the composite of heart failure hospitalization and death and its association with SVi, LVEF, GLS and MCF was tested by Cox proportional hazard modelling.

WHF characterized by outpatient intensification of oral loop diuretics is common yet its prognostic implications for ATTR-CM patients relative to other WHF events remains unclear. We assessed how WHF characterized by outpatient diuretic intensification (ODI) relates to mortality in this population. METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a retrospective study of ATTR-CM patients presenting to the Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Oral loop diuretic dose was recorded longitudinally. WHF characterized by ODI was defined as a persistent increase in oral loop diuretic dose lasting >1 month. We analysed the all-cause mortality rate after either WHF event (hospitalization or ODI) relative to subjects who had no WHF event.

Instead, it describes a case where cytarabine was used as part of leukemia treatment, and no cardiac events occurred during its administration. However, there is no indication that cytarabine treats or improves heart failure or Alzheimer disease, nor is there evidence of harm in this context. Thus, the effectiveness of cytarabine for these diseases remains...\n",

      "Explanation: The abstract provides evidence that digoxin is effective as a transplacental antiarrhythmic therapy for fetal supraventricular tachyarrhythmia, with clinical consensus and trial confirmation of its efficacy and safety in this context. However, it does not specifically address the use of digoxin for heart failure (outside of arrhythmia-related fetal cases) or Alzheimer disease. Therefore, based on the abstract alone, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that di...\n",

      "Explanation: The abstract reports that donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor, is associated with reduced mortality and a lower risk of hospitalization due to heart failure in patients with both heart failure and Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, donepezil (along with galantamine, but not rivastigmine) was linked to improved survival and decreased hospital care for heart failure, indicating effectiveness for both conditions in this patient population.\n",
