# LLM-based Prioritization Framework for Alzheimer’s Therapeutics

This repository contains the LLM-driven evidence synthesis pipeline and the replication guide for the paper: **"Bridging the Computational-Experimental Gap: Leveraging Large Language Model to Prioritize Alzheimer’s Therapeutics Based on Comparison of Learning Models"**.

## 📂 Repository Contents

* **`LLM_validation1125run.ipynb`**: The master notebook that executes the core pipeline:
    1.  **Data Loading:** Imports the 90 candidate drugs generated by the graph models and the corresponding PubMed abstracts.
    2.  **Evidence Synthesis:** Queries the GPT-4.1 API.

* **`resultanalysis.ipynb`**: Applies the prioritization criteria to rank the drugs based on the LLM outputs.

* **`drug_disease_long_format_20250325_190703.csv`**: Contains the input files.

## 🚀 How to Run the Code

The workflow is consolidated into the `LLM_validation1125run.ipynb` notebook for ease of replication.

1.  Set your OpenAI API key in a file named **`openai_api.txt`**.
2.  Open **`LLM_validation1125run.ipynb`**.
3.  Run all cells to execute the evidence synthesis.
4.  Run **`resultanalysis.ipynb`** to generate the final lists.

## 🔬 Replication Guide for Candidate Generation (Graph Models)

The input for `LLM_validation1125run.ipynb` is a list of candidate drugs. These candidates were generated using three state-of-the-art models. To replicate this upstream step, we utilized the official implementations adapted for the **PrimeKG** dataset:

### 1. TxGNN
We utilized the official pre-trained weights and zero-shot prediction scores.
* **Repository:** [https://github.com/mims-harvard/TxGNN](https://github.com/mims-harvard/TxGNN)

### 2. CompGCN
We retrained the model on PrimeKG using the standard link prediction setting.
* **Repository:** [https://github.com/malllabiisc/CompGCN](https://github.com/malllabiisc/CompGCN)

### 3. RLR (Hetionet)
We computed Degree-Weighted Path Counts (DWPC) using the `learn` and `hetnet_ml` packages.
